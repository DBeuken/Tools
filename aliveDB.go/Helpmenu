This tool can be used to check if websites are alive. 
To do that, this tool uses the "fping"-command.
The strength of this tool however, is that threading is supported.

To use this tool, you have to specify a file that contains sites. 

TAGS:
The underlying tags can be used.
	-th	: Amount of threads. 
		  Default = 4
	-t	: Time in seconds to wait after every request. This slows down the amount of requests
		  per second.
		  Default = 0 seconds
	-f	: File to use
		  The file should contain 1 site per line so that this tool can handle each site one
		  by one.


EXAMPLE SYNTAX:
	aliveDB -th 8 -f sites.txt -t 2	  //Threads: 8; File: sites.txt; Intermediate time: 2 seconds
	aliveDB -f sites.txt		  //Threads: 4; File: sites.txt; Intermediate time: 0 seconds
	aliveDB -f domains.txt -t 1	  //Threads: 4; File: domains.txt; Intermediate time: 1 second
